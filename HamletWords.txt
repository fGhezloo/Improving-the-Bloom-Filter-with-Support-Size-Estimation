Horatio

but
our
fantasy
And
will
not

belief

hold
of
him
Touching
this
dreaded
sight
twice
seen
of

Therefore
have
entreated
him
along
With
us
to
watch

minutes
of
this
night

fortified

What
we
two
nights
have
seen
Hor
Well
sit
we
down
And
let
us
hear
Bernardo
speak
of
this
Ber
Last
night
of
all
When
yond
same
star
that
westward
from
the
pole
Had
made
his
course
to
illume
that
part
of
heaven
Where
now
it
burns

beating

Peace

where
it
comes
again

Ghost

In
the
same
figure
like
the
king
that
dead

Thou
art
scholar
speak
to
it
Horatio
Ber
Looks
it
not
like
the
King

Most
like
it
harrows
me
with
fear
and
wonder
Ber
It
would
be
spoke
to
Mar
Question
it
Horatio
Hor
What
art
thou
that
usurp
st
this
time
of
night
Together
with
that
fair
and
warlike
form
In
which
the
majesty
of
buried
Denmark
Did
sometimes
march
By
heaven
charge
thee
speak
Mar
It
is
offended
Ber
See
it
stalks
away
Hor
Stay
speak
speak
charge
thee

Exit
Ghost
Mar
Tis
gone
and
will
not
answer
Ber
How
now
Horatio
You
tremble
and
look
pale
Is
not
this
something
more
than
fantasy
What
think
you
on
Hor
Before
my
God
might
not
this
believe
Without
the
sensible
and
true
avouch
Of
mine
own
eyes
Mar
Is
it
not
like
the
King
Hor
As
thou
art
to
thyself
Such
was
the
very
armour
he
had
on
When
he
the
ambitious
Norway
combated
So
frown
he
once
when
in
an
angry
parle
He
smote
the
sledded
Polacks
on
the
ice
Tis
strange
Mar
Thus
twice
before
and
jump
at
this
dead
hour
With
martial
stalk
hath
he
gone
by
our
watch
Hor
In
what
particular
thought
to
work
know
not
But
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
my
opinion
This
bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
Mar
Good
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
that
knows
Why
this
same
strict
and
most
observant
watch
So
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
And
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
And
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
Why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
whose
sore
task
Does
not
divide
the
Sunday
from
the
week
What
might
be
toward
that
this
sweaty
haste
Doth
make
the
night
joint
labourer
with
the
day
Who
is
that
can
inform
me
Hor
That
can
At
least
the
whisper
goes
so
Our
last
king
Whose
image
even
but
now
appear
to
us
Was
as
you
know
by
Fortinbras
of
Norway
Thereto
prick
on
by
most
emulate
pride
Dar
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
Hamlet
For
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteem
him
Did
slay
this
Fortinbras
who
by
seal
compact
Well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
Did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
Which
he
stood
seiz
of
to
the
conqueror
Against
the
which
moiety
competent
Was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
return
To
the
inheritance
of
Fortinbras
Had
he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the
same
cov
nant
And
carriage
of
the
article
design
His
fell
to
Hamlet
Now
sir
young
Fortinbras
Of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
Hath
in
the
skirts
of
Norway
here
and
there
Shark
up
list
of
lawless
resolutes
For
food
and
diet
to
some
enterprise
That
hath
stomach
in
which
is
no
other
As
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
But
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
And
terms
compulsatory
those
foresaid
lands
So
by
his
father
lost
and
this
take
it
Is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
The
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
Of
this
post
haste
and
romage
in
the
land
Ber
think
it
be
no
other
but
en
so
Well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
Comes
armed
through
our
watch
so
like
the
king
That
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
Hor
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
mind
eye
In
the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
Rome
little
ere
the
mightiest
Julius
fell
The
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
Did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
Roman
streets
As
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of
blood
Disasters
in
the
sun
and
the
moist
star
Upon
whose
influence
Neptune
empire
stands
Was
sick
almost
to
doomsday
with
eclipse
And
even
the
like
precurse
of
fierce
events
As
harbingers
preceding
still
the
fates
And
prologue
to
the
omen
coming
on
Have
heaven
and
earth
together
demonstrated
Unto
our
climature
and
countrymen
But
soft
behold
lo
where
it
comes
again
Re
enter
Ghost
ll
cross
it
though
it
blast
me
Stay
illusion
If
thou
hast
any
sound
or
use
of
voice
Speak
to
me
If
there
be
any
good
thing
to
be
done
That
may
to
thee
do
ease
and
race
to
me
Speak
to
me
If
thou
art
privy
to
thy
country
fate
Which
happily
foreknowing
may
avoid
speak
Or
if
thou
hast
uphoarded
in
thy
life
Extorted
treasure
in
the
womb
of
earth
For
which
they
say
you
spirits
oft
walk
in
death
The
cock
crows
Speak
of
it
stay
and
speak
Stop
it
Marcellus
Mar
Shall
strike
at
it
with
my
partisan
Hor
Do
if
it
will
not
stand
Ber
Tis
here
Hor
Tis
here
Mar
Tis
gone
Exit
Ghost
We
do
it
wrong
being
so
majestical
To
offer
it
the
show
of
violence
For
it
is
as
the
air
invulnerable
And
our
vain
blows
malicious
mockery
Ber
It
was
about
to
speak
when
the
cock
crew
Hor
And
then
it
started
like
guilty
thing
Upon
fearful
summons
have
heard
The
cock
that
is
the
trumpet
to
the
morn
Doth
with
his
lofty
and
shrill
sounding
throat
Awake
the
god
of
day
and
at
his
warning
Whether
in
sea
or
fire
in
earth
or
air
The
extravagant
and
erring
spirit
hies
To
his
confine
and
of
the
truth
herein
This
present
object
made
probation
Mar
It
faded
on
the
crowing
of
the
cock
Some
say
that
ever
gainst
that
season
comes
Wherein
our
Saviour
birth
is
celebrated
The
bird
of
dawning
singeth
all
night
long
And
then
they
say
no
spirit
dare
stir
abroad
The
nights
are
wholesome
then
no
planets
strike
No
fairy
takes
nor
witch
hath
power
to
charm
So
hallow
and
so
gracious
is
the
time
Hor
So
have
heard
and
do
in
part
believe
it
But
look
the
morn
in
russet
mantle
clad
Walks
er
the
dew
of
yon
high
eastward
hill
Break
we
our
watch
up
and
by
my
advice
Let
us
impart
what
we
have
seen
to
night
Unto
young
Hamlet
for
upon
my
life
This
spirit
dumb
to
us
will
speak
to
him
Do
you
consent
we
shall
acquaint
him
with
it
As
needful
in
our
loves
fitting
our
duty
Mar
Let
do
pray
and
this
morning
know
Where
we
shall
find
him
most
conveniently

room
of

Castle
Enter
the
King
Queen
Hamlet
Polonius
Laertes
Voltimand
Cornelius
Lords
and
Attendant
King
Though
yet
of
Hamlet
our
dear
brother
death
The
memory
be
green
and
that
it
us
befitted
To
bear
our
hearts
in
grief
and
our
whole
kingdom
To
be
contracted
in
one
brow
of
woe
Yet
so
far
hath
discretion
fought
with
nature
That
we
with
wisest
sorrow
think
on
him
Together
with
remembrance
of
ourselves
Therefore
our
sometime
sister
now
our
queen
Th
imperial
jointress
to
this
warlike
state
Have
we
as
twere
with
defeated
joy
With
an
auspicious
and
one
dropping
eye
With
mirth
in
funeral
and
with
dirge
in
marriage
In
equal
scale
weighing
delight
and
dole
Taken
to
wife
nor
have
we
herein
barr
Your
better
wisdoms
which
have
freely
gone
With
this
affair
along
or
all
our
thanks
Now
follows
that
you
know
young
Fortinbras
Holding
weak
supposal
of
our
worth
Or
thinking
by
our
late
dear
brother
death
Our
state
to
be
disjoint
and
out
of
frame
Colleagued
with
this
dream
of
his
advantage
He
hath
not
fail
to
pester
us
with
message
Importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
Lost
by
his
father
with
all
bonds
of
law
To
our
most
valiant
brother
So
much
for
him
Now
for
ourself
and
for
this
time
of
meeting
Thus
much
the
business
is
we
have
here
writ
To
Norway
uncle
of
young
Fortinbras
Who
impotent
and
bed
rid
scarcely
hears
Of
this
his
nephew
purpose
to
suppress
His
further
gait
herein
in
that
the
levies
The
lists
and
full
proportions
are
all
made
Out
of
his
subject
and
we
here
dispatch
You
good
Cornelius
and
you
Voltimand
For
bearers
of
this
greeting
to
old
Norway
Giving
to
you
no
further
personal
power
To
business
with
the
king
more
than
the
scope
Of
these
dilated
articles
allow
Farewell
and
let
your
haste
commend
your
duty
Cor
and
Volt
In
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty
King
We
doubt
it
nothing
heartily
farewell
Exeunt
Voltimand
and
Cornelius
And
now
Laertes
what
the
news
with
you
You
told
us
of
some
suit
what
is
Laertes
You
cannot
speak
of
reason
to
the
Dane
And
lose
your
voice
what
wouldst
thou
beg
Laertes
That
shall
not
be
my
offer
not
thy
asking
The
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
The
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
Than
is
the
throne
of
Denmark
to
thy
father
What
wouldst
thou
have
Laertes
Laer
Dread
my
lord
Your
leave
and
favour
to
return
to
France
From
whence
though
willingly
came
to
Denmark
To
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
Yet
now
must
confess
that
duty
done
My
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
France
And
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
King
Have
you
your
father
leave
What
says
Polonius
Pol
He
hath
my
lord
wrung
from
me
my
slow
leave
By
laboursome
petition
and
at
last
Upon
his
will
seal
my
hard
consent
do
beseech
you
give
him
leave
to
go
King
Take
thy
fair
hour
Laertes
time
be
thine
And
thy
best
graces
spend
it
at
thy
will
But
now
my
cousin
Hamlet
and
my
son
Ham
Aside
little
more
than
kin
and
less
than
kind
King
How
is
it
that
the
clouds
still
hang
on
you
Ham
Not
so
my
lord
am
too
much
the
sun
Queen
Good
Hamlet
cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
And
let
thine
eye
look
like
friend
on
Denmark
Do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
Seek
for
thy
noble
father
in
the
dust
Thou
know
st
tis
common
all
that
lives
must
die
Passing
through
nature
to
eternity
Ham
Ay
madam
it
is
common
Queen
If
it
be
Why
seems
it
so
particular
with
thee
Ham
Seems
madam
Nay
it
is
know
not
seems
Tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
good
mother
Nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
Nor
windy
suspiration
of
forc
breath
No
nor
the
fruitful
river
in
the
eye
Nor
the
dejected
havior
of
the
visage
Together
with
all
forms
moods
shows
of
grief
That
can
denote
me
truly
these
indeed
seem
For
they
are
actions
that
man
might
play
But
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
These
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
woe
King
Tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
Hamlet
To
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
But
you
must
know
your
father
lost
father
That
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
In
filial
obligation
for
some
term
To
do
obsequious
sorrow
but
to
persevere
In
obstinate
condolement
is
course
Of
impious
stubbornness
tis
unmanly
grief
It
shows
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
heart
unfortified
mind
impatient
An
understanding
simple
and
unschool
For
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
As
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
Why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
Take
it
to
heart
Fie
tis
fault
to
heaven
fault
against
the
dead
fault
to
nature
To
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
Is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
From
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
to
day
This
must
be
so
We
pray
you
throw
to
earth
This
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
As
of
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
You
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
And
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
Than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
Do
impart
toward
you
For
your
intent
In
going
back
to
school
in
Wittenberg
It
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
And
we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
Here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our
eye
Our
chiefest
courtier
cousin
and
our
son
Queen
Let
not
thy
mother
lose
her
prayers
Hamlet
pray
thee
stay
with
us
go
not
to
Wittenberg
Ham
shall
in
all
my
best
obey
you
madam
King
Why
tis
loving
and
fair
reply
Be
as
ourself
in
Denmark
Madam
come
This
gentle
and
unforc
accord
of
Hamlet
Sits
smiling
to
my
heart
in
grace
whereof
No
jocund
health
that
Denmark
drinks
to
day
But
the
great
cannon
to
the
clouds
shall
tell
And
the
king
rouse
the
heaven
shall
bruit
again
Re
speaking
earthly
thunder
Come
away
Exeunt
all
but
Hamlet
Ham
that
this
too
too
solid
flesh
would
melt
Thaw
and
resolve
itself
into
dew
Or
that
the
Everlasting
had
not
fix
His
canon
gainst
self
slaughter
God
God
How
weary
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
Seem
to
me
all
the
uses
of
this
world
Fie
on
fie
tis
an
unweeded
garden
That
grows
to
seed
things
rank
and
gross
in
nature
Possess
it
merely
That
it
should
come
to
this
But
two
months
dead
nay
not
so
much
not
two
So
excellent
king
that
was
to
this
Hyperion
to
satyr
so
loving
to
my
mother
That
he
might
not
beteem
the
winds
of
heaven
Visit
her
face
too
roughly
Heaven
and
earth
Must
remember
Why
she
would
hang
on
him
As
if
increase
of
appetite
had
grown
By
what
it
fed
on
and
yet
within
month
Let
me
not
think
on
Frailty
thy
name
is
woman
little

With
which
she
followed
my
poor
father
body
Like
Niobe
all
tears
why
she
even
she
God
beast
that
wants
discourse
of
reason
Would
have
mourn
longer
married
with
mine
uncle
My
father
brother
but
no
more
like
my
father
Than
to
Hercules
within
month
Ere
yet
the
salt
of
most
unrighteous
tears
Had
left
the
flushing
in
her
galled
eyes
She
married
most
wicked
speed
to
post
With
such
dexterity
to
incestuous
sheets
It
is
not
nor
it
cannot
come
to
good
But
break

Hail
to
your
lordship
Ham
am
glad
to

The

Sir

Horatio

My

Good

sir
But
what
in
faith
make
you
from
Wittenberg
Hor
truant
disposition
good
my
lord
Ham
would
not
hear
your
enemy
say
so
Nor
shall
you
do
my
ear
that
violence
To
make
it
truster
of
your
own
report
Against
yourself
know
you
are
no
truant
But
what
is
your
affair
in
Elsinore
We
ll
teach
you
to
drink
deep
ere
you
depart
Hor
My
lord
came
to
see
your
father
funeral
Ham
prithee
do
not
mock
me
fellow

it
was
to

my

Hor
Indeed
my

hard
upon
Ham
Thrift
thrift
Horatio
The
funeral
bak
meats
Did
coldly
furnish
forth
the
marriage
tables
Would

met
my
dearest
foe
in
heaven
Or
ever
had
seen
that
day
Horatio
My
father
methinks
see
my
father
Hor
Where
my
lord
Ham
In
my
mind
eye
Horatio
Hor
saw
him
once
he
was
goodly
king
Ham
He
was
man
take
him
for
all
in
all
shall
not
look
upon
his
like

Hor
My

saw
him
yesternight
Ham
Saw
who
Hor
My

Ham
The

Season
your
admiration
for
awhile
With
an
attent
ear
till
may
deliver
Upon
the
witness
of
these
gentlemen
This
marvel
to
you
Ham
For
God
love
let
me
hear
Hor
Two
nights
together
had
these
gentlemen
Marcellus
and
Bernardo
on
their
watch
In
the
dead
vast
and
middle
of
the
night
Been
thus
encounter
figure
like
your
father
Armed
at
point
exactly
cap
pe
Appears
before
them
and
with
solemn
march
Goes
slow
and
stately
by
them
thrice
he
walk
By
their
oppress
and
fear
surprised
eyes
Within
his
truncheon
length
whilst
they
distill
Almost
to
jelly
with
the
act
of
fear
Stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
This
to
me
In
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
And
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
Where
as
they
had
deliver
both
in
time
Form
of
the
thing
each
word
made
true
and
good
The
apparition
comes
knew
your
father
These
hands
are
not
more
like
Ham
But
where
was
this
Mar
My
lord
upon
the
platform
where
we
watch
Ham
Did
you
not
speak
to
it
Hor
My
lord
did
But
answer
made
it
none
yet
once
methought
It
lifted
up
it
head
and
did
address
Itself
to
motion
like
as
it
would
speak
But
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
And
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
And
vanish
from
our
sight
Ham
Tis
very
strange
Hor
As
do
live
my
honour
lord
tis
true
And
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
To
let
you
know
of
it
Ham
Indeed
indeed
sirs
but
this
troubles
me
Hold
you
the
watch
to
night
Mar

We

Ham
Arm
say
you
Both
Arm
my
lord
Ham
From
top

Both
My
lord
from
head
to

Ham
Then
saw
you
not
his
face
Hor
yes
my
lord
he
wore
his
beaver
up
Ham
What
look
he
frowningly
Hor
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
Ham
Pale
or
red
Hor
Nay
very
pale
Ham
And
fix
his
eyes
upon
you
Hor
Most
constantly
Ham
would
had
been
there
Hor
It
would
have
much
amaz
you
Ham
Very
like
very
like
Stay
it
long
Hor
While
one
with
moderate
haste
might
tell
hundred
Mar

Ber
Longer
longer

Not
when
saw
Ham
His
beard
was
grizzled
no
Hor
It
was
as
have
seen
it
in
his
life
sable
silver
Ham
will
watch
to
night
Perchance
twill
walk
again
Hor
warr
nt
it
will
Ham
If
it
assume
my
noble
father
person
ll
speak
to
it
though
hell
itself
should
gape
And
bid
me
hold
my
peace
pray
you
all
If
you
have
hitherto
conceal
this
sight
Let
it
be
tenable
in
your
silence
still
And
whatsoever
else
shall
hap
to
night
Give
it
an
understanding
but
no
tongue
will
requite
your
loves
So
fare
ye
well
Upon
the
platform
twixt
eleven
and
twelve

visit
you
All
Our

to
your

Exeunt

My

farewell
And

And

let

Do
you
doubt
that
Laer
For
Hamlet
and
the
trifling
of
his
favour
Hold
it
fashion
and
toy
in
blood
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
Forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
The
perfume
and
suppliance
of
minute
No
more
Oph
No
more
but
so
Laer
Think
it
no
more
For
nature
crescent
does
not
grow
alone
In
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
The
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
Grows
wide
withal
Perhaps
he
loves
you
now
And
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
The
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
His
greatness
weigh
his
will
is
not
his
own
For
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
He
may
not
as
unvalu
persons
do
Carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
The
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
And
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscrib
Unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
Whereof
he
is
the
head
Then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
It
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
As
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
May
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
Than
the
main
voice
of
Denmark
goes
withal
Then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
If
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
Or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
To
his
unmaster
importunity
Fear
it
Ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
And
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
Out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
The
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
If
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
Virtue
itself
scopes
not
calumnious
strokes
The
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
Too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclos
And
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of
youth
Contagious
blastments
are
most
imminent
Be
wary
then
best
safety
lies
in
fear
Youth
to
itself
rebels
though
none
else
near
Oph
shall
th
effect
of
this
good
lesson
keep
As
watchman

But
good
my

Do
not
as
some
ungracious
pastors
do
Show
me
the
steep
and
thorny
way
to
heaven
Whilst
like
puff
and
reckless
libertine
Himself
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
treads
And
recks
not
his

stay
too
long

Yet
here
Laertes

shame
The
wind
sits
in

your

And
you
are
stay
for
There
my
blessing
with
thee
Laying
his
hand
on
Laertes
head
And
these
few
precepts
in
thy
memory
Look
thou
character
Give
thy
thoughts
no
tongue
Nor
any
unproportion
thought
his
act
Be
thou
familiar
but
by
no
means
vulgar
Those
friends
thou
hast
and
their
adoption
tried
Grapple
them
unto
thy
soul
with
hoops
of
steel
But
do
not
dull
thy
palm
with
entertainment
Of
each
new
hatch
unfledg
comrade
Beware
Of
entrance
to
quarrel
but
being
in
Bear
that
the
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
Give
every
man
thine
ear
but
few
thy
voice
Take
each
man
censure
but
reserve
thy
judgment
Costly
thy
habit
as
thy
purse
can
buy
But
not
express
in
fancy
rich
not
gaudy
For
the
apparel
oft
proclaims
the
man
And
they
in
France
of
the
best
rank
and
station
Are
most
select
and
generous
chief
in
that
Neither
borrower
nor
lender
be
For
loan
oft
loses
both
itself
and
friend
And
borrowing
dulls
the
edge
of
husbandry
This
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
And
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
Thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
Farewell
my
blessing

Most
humbly

take
my
leave

Farewell

Marry
well

told

he

very
oft
of
late
Given
private
time
to
you

you
yourself
Have
of
your
audience
been
most
free
and
bounteous
If
it
be
so
as
so
tis
put
on
me
And
that
in
way
of
caution
must
tell
you
You
do
not
understand
yourself
so
clearly
As
it
behooves
my
daughter
and
your
honour
What
is
between
you
give
me
up
the
truth
Oph
He
hath
my
lord
of
late
made
many
tenders
Of
his
affection
to
me
Pol
Affection
pooh
you
speak
like
green
girl
Unsifted
in
such
perilous
circumstance
Do
you
believe
his
tenders
as
you
call
them
Oph
do
not
know
my
lord
what
should
think
Pol
Marry
ll
teach
you
think
yourself
baby
That
you
have
ta
en
these
tenders
for
true
pay
Which
are
not
sterling
Tender
yourself
more
dearly
Or
not
to
crack
the
wind
of
the
poor
phrase
Wronging
it
thus
you

tender
me
fool
Oph
My

hath
importun
me
with
love
In
honourable
fashion
Pol
Ay
fashion
you
may
call
it
go
to
go
to
Oph
And
hath
given
countenance
to
his
speech
my
lord
With
almost
all
the
holy
vows
of
heaven
Pol
Ay
springes
to
catch
woodcocks
do
know
When
the
blood
burns
how
prodigal
the
soul
Lends
the
tongue
vows
these
blazes
daughter
Giving
more
light
than
heat
extinct
in
both
Even
in
their
promise
as
it
is
making
You
must
not
take
for
fire
From
this
time
Be
something
scanter
of
your
maiden
presence
Set
your
entreatments
at
higher
rate
Than
command
to
parley
For
Lord
Hamlet
Believe
so
much
in
him
that
he
is
young
And
with
larger
tether
may
he
walk
Than
may
be
given
you
in
few
Ophelia
Do
not
believe
his
vows
for
they
are
brokers
Not
of
that
dye
which
their
investments
show
But
mere
implorators
of
unholy
suits
Breathing
like
sanctified
and
pious
bawds
The
better
to
beguile
This
is
for
all
would
not
in
plain
terms
from
this
time
forth
Have
you
so
slander
any
moment
leisure
As
to
give
words
or
talk
with
the
Lord
Hamlet
Look
to
charge
you
come
your
ways
Oph
shall
obey
my
lord
Exeunt
Scene
IV
The
platform
Enter
Hamlet
Horatio
and
Marcellus
Ham
The
air
bites
shrewdly
it
is
very
cold
Hor
It
is
nipping
and
an
eager
air
Ham
What
hour
now
Hor
think
it
lacks
of
twelve
Mar
No
it
is
struck
Hor
Indeed
heard
it
not
then
draws
near
the
season
Wherein
the
spirit
held
his
wont
to
walk
flourish
of
trumpets
and
ordnance
shot
off
within
What
does
this
mean
my
lord
Ham
The
King
doth
wake
to
night
and
takes
his
rouse
Keeps
wassail
and
the
swaggering
up
spring
reels
And
as
he
drains
his
draughts
of
Rhenish
down
The
kettle
drum
and
trumpet
thus
bray
out
The
triumph
of
his
pledge
Hor
Is
it
custom
Ham
Ay
marry
is
But
to
my
mind
though
am
native
here
And
to
the
manner
born
it
is
custom
More
honour
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
This
heavy
headed
revel
east
and
west
Makes
us
traduc
and
tax
of
other
nations
They
clepe
us
drunkards
and
with
swinish
phrase
Soil
our
addition
and
indeed
it
takes
From
our
achievements
though
perform
at
height
The
pith
and
marrow
of
our
attribute
So
oft
it
chances
in
particular
men
That
for
some
vicious
mole
of
nature
in
them
As
in
their
birth
wherein
they
are
not
guilty
Since
nature
cannot
choose
his
origin
By
the
ergrowth
of
some
complexion
Oft
breaking
down
the
pales
and
forts
of
reason
Or
by
some
habit
that
too
much
er
leavens
The
form
of
plausive
manners
that
these
men
Carrying
say
the
stamp
of
one
defect
Being
nature
livery
or
fortune
star
Their
virtues
else
be
they
as
pure
as
grace
As
infinite
as
man
may
undergo
Shall
in
the
general
censure
take
corruption
From
that
particular
fault
the
dram
of
eale
Doth
all
the
noble
substance
often
doubt
To
his
own
scandal

Why

death
Have
burst
their
cerements
why
the
sepulchre
Wherein
we
saw
thee
quietly
in
urn
Hath
op
his
ponderous

marble
jaws
To
cast
thee
up
again
What
may
this
mean
That
thou
dead
corse
again
in
complete
steel
Revisit
st
thus
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
Making
night
hideous
and
we
fools
of
nature
So
horridly
to
shake
our
disposition
With
thoughts
beyond
the
reaches
of
our
souls
Say
why
is
this
wherefore
what
should
we
do
Ghost
beckons
Hamlet
Hor
It
beckons
you
to
go
away
with

As
if
it
some

did

To
you

Look
with
what
courteous
action
It
waves
you
to
more
removed
ground
But
do
not
go
with
it
Hor
No
by
no
means
Ham
It
will
not
speak
then
will
follow
it
Hor
Do
not
my
lord
Ham
Why
what
should
be
the
fear
do
not
set
my
life
at
pin
fee
And
for
my
soul
what
can
it
do
to
that
Being
thing
immortal

It
waves
me
forth
again
ll
follow
it
Hor
What
if
it
tempt
you
toward
the
flood
my
lord
Or
to
the
dreadful
summit
of
the
cliff
That
beetles
er
his
base
into
the
sea
And
there
assume
some
other
horrible
form
Which
might
deprive
your
sovereignty
of
reason
And
draw
you
into
madness
think
of
it
The
very
place
puts
toys
of
desperation
Without
more
motive
into
every
brain
That
looks
so
many
fadoms
to
the
sea
And
hears
it
roar
beneath
Ham
It
waves
me
still
Go
on

follow
thee

You
shall
not
go
my
lord
Ham
Hold
off
your

Hor
Be

My

And

As

Ghost
My

When
to
sulph

and
tormenting
flames
Must
render
up
myself
Ham
Alas
poor
ghost
Ghost
Pity
me
not
but
lend
thy
serious
hearing
To
what
shall
unfold
Ham
Speak
am
bound

Ghost
So
art
thou
to
revenge
when
thou
shalt
hear
Ham
What
Ghost

thy

Doom
for
certain

to
walk

And
for

Till
the
foul

done
in

Are
burnt
and
purg
away
But
that
am
forbid
To
tell
the
secrets
of
my
prison
house
could
tale
unfold
whose
lightest
word
Would
harrow
up
thy
soul
freeze
thy
young
blood
Make
thy
two
eyes
like
stars
start
from
their
spheres
Thy
knotted
and
combined
locks
to
part
And
each
particular
hair
to
stand
on
end
Like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porcupine
But
this
eternal
blazon
must
not
be
To
ears
of
flesh
and
blood
List

If
thou
didst
ever
thy
dear

God
Ghost
Revenge
his
foul
and
most
unnatural
murder
Ham
Murder
Ghost
Murder
most
foul
as
in
the
best
it
is
But
this
most
foul
strange
and
unnatural
Ham
Haste
me
to
know
that
with
wings
as
swift
As
meditation
or
the
thoughts
of
love
May
sweep
to
my
revenge
Ghost
find
thee
apt
And
duller
shouldst
thou
be
than
the
fat
weed
That
rots
itself
in
ease
on
Lethe
wharf
Wouldst
thou
not
stir
in
this
Now
Hamlet
hear
Tis
given
out
that
sleeping
in
my
orchard
serpent
stung
me
so
the
whole
ear
of
Denmark
Is
by
forged
process
of
my
death
Rankly
abus
but
know
thou
noble
youth
The
serpent
that
did
sting
thy
father
life
Now
wears
his
crown
Ham
my
prophetic
soul
Mine
uncle
Ghost
Ay
that
incestuous
that
adulterate
beast
With
witchcraft
of
his
wit
with
traitorous
gifts
wicked
wit
and
gifts
that
have
the
power
So
to
seduce
won
to
his
shameful
lust
The
will
of
my
most
seeming
virtuous
queen
Hamlet
what
falling
off
was
there
From
me
whose
love
was
of
that
dignity
That
it
went
hand
in
hand
even
with
the
vow
made
to
her
in
marriage
and
to
decline
Upon
wretch
whose
natural
gifts
were
poor
To
those
of
mine
But
virtue
as
it
never
will
be
mov
Though
lewdness
court
it
in
shape
of
heaven
So
lust
though
to
radiant
angel
link
Will
sate
itself
in
celestial
bed
And
prey
on
garbage
But
soft
methinks
scent
the
morning
air
Brief
let
me
be
Sleeping
within
my
orchard
My
custom
always
of
the
afternoon
Upon
my
secure
hour
thy
uncle
stole
With
juice
of
cursed
hebenon
in
vial
And
in
the
porches
of
my
ears
did
pour
The
leperous
distilment
whose
effect
Holds
such
an
enmity
with
blood
of
man
That
swift
as
quicksilver
it
courses
through
The
natural
gates
and
alleys
of
the
body
And
with
sudden
vigour
it
doth
posset
And
curd
like
eager
droppings
into
milk
The
thin
and
wholesome
blood
so
did
it
mine
And
most
instant
tetter
bark
about
Most
lazar
like
with
vile
and
loathsome
crust
All
my
smooth
body
Thus
was
sleeping
by
brother
hand
Of
life
of
crown
of
queen
at
once
dispatch
Cut
off
even
in
the
blossoms
of
my
sin
Unhous
led
disappointed
unanel
No
reckoning
made
but
sent
to
my
account
With
all
my
imperfections
on
my
head
horrible
horrible
most
horrible
If
thou
hast
nature
in
thee
bear
it
not
Let
not
the
royal
bed
of
Denmark
be
couch
for
luxury
and
damned
incest
But
howsoever
thou
pursu
st
this
act
Taint
not
thy
mind
nor
let
thy
soul
contrive
Against
thy
mother
aught
leave
her
to
heaven
And
to
those
thorns
that
in
her
bosom
lodge
To
prick
and
sting
her
Fare
thee
well
at
once
The
glowworm
shows
the
matin
to
be
near
And
gins
to
pale
his
uneffectual
fire
Adieu
adieu

Exit
Ham

And
shall
couple

Hold
my

And

But

stiffly
up
Remember

Ay

while

In

Remember
thee
Yea
from
the
table
of

wipe
away
all

fond
records
All

of

all

all

past
That

and

And
thy
commandment
all

Within

Unmix

To

Why

And

Touching

For

Come

Once

good
friends
Hor
day
and
night
but
this
is
wondrous
strange
Ham
And
therefore
as
stranger
give
it
welcome
There
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
Horatio
Than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
But
come
Here
as
before
never
so
help
you
mercy
How
strange
or
odd
soe
er
bear
myself
As
perchance
hereafter
shall
think
meet
To
put
an
antic
disposition
on
That
you
at
such
times
seeing
me
never
shall
With
arms
encumber
thus
or
this
head
shake
Or
by
pronouncing
of
some
doubtful
phrase
As
Well
well
we
know
or
We
could
an
if
we
would
Or
If
we
list
to
speak
or
There
be
an
if
they
might
Or
such
ambiguous
giving
out
to
note
That
you
know
aught
of
me
this
is
not
to
do
So
grace
and
mercy
at
your
most
need
help
you
Swear
Ghost
Beneath
Swear
Ham
Rest
rest
perturbed
spirit
So
gentlemen
With
all
my
love
do
commend
me
to
you
And
what
so
poor
man
as
Hamlet
is
May
do
to
express
his
love
and
friending
to
you
God
willing
shall
not
lack
Let
us
go
in
together
And
still
your
fingers
on
your
lips
pray
The
time
is
out
of
joint
cursed
spite
That
ever
was
born
to
set
it
right
Nay
come

Enter
Polonius
and
Reynaldo

Give
him
this

notes
Reynaldo
Rey
will
my
lord
Pol
You
shall
do
marvellous
wisely
good
Reynaldo
Before
You
visit
him
to
make
inquiry
Of
his
behaviour
Rey
My
lord
did
intend
it
Pol
Marry
well
said
very
well
said
Look
you
sir
Enquire
me
first
what
Danskers
are
in
Paris
And
how
and
who
what
means
and
where
they
keep
What
company
at
what
expense
and
finding
By
this
encompassment
and
drift
of
question
That
they
do
know
my
son
come
you
more
nearer
Than
your
particular
demands
will
touch
it
Take
you
as
twere
some
distant
knowledge
of
him
As
thus
know
his
father
and
his
friends
And
in
part
hi
do
you
mark
this
Reynaldo
Rey
Ay
very
well
my
lord
Pol
And
in
part
him
but
you
may
say
not
well
But
if
be
he
mean
he
very
wild
Addicted
so
and
so
and
there
put
on
him
What
forgeries
you
please
marry
none
so
rank
As
may
dishonour
him
take
heed
of
that
But
sir
such
wanton
wild
and
usual
slips
As
are
companions
noted
and
most
known
To
youth
and
liberty
Rey
As
gaming
my
lord
Pol
Ay
or
drinking
fencing
swearing
quarrelling
Drabbing
you
may
go
so
far
Rey
My
lord
that
would
dishonour
him
Pol
Faith
no
as
you
may
season
it
in
the
charge
You
must
not
put
another
scandal
on
him
That
he
is
open
to
incontinency
That
not
my
meaning
but
breathe
his
faults
so
quaintly
That
they
may
seem
the
taints
of
liberty
The
flash
and
outbreak
of
fiery
mind
savageness
in
unreclaimed
blood
Of
general
assault
Rey
But
my
good
lord
Pol
Wherefore
should
you
do
this
Rey
Ay
my
lord
would
know
that
Pol
Marry
sir
here
my
drift
And
believe
it
is
fetch
of
warrant
You
laying
these
slight
sullies
on
my
son
As
twere
thing
little
soil
the
working
Mark
you
Your
party
in
converse
him
you
would
sound
Having
ever
seen
in
the
prenominate
crimes
The
youth
you
breathe
of
guilty
be
assur
He
closes
with
you
in
this
consequence
Good
sir
or
so
or
friend
or
gentleman
According
to
the
phrase
or
the
addition
Of
man
and
country
Rey
Very
good
my
lord
Pol
And
then
sir
does
he
this
he
does
What
was
about
to
say
By
the
mass
was
about
to
say
something
Where
did
leave
Rey
At
closes
in
the
consequence
at
friend
or
so
and
gentleman
Pol
At
closes
in
the
consequence
ay
marry
He
closes
with
you
thus
know
the
gentleman
saw
him
yesterday
or
other
day
Or
then
or
then
with
such
or
such
and
as
you
say
There
was
he
gaming
there
ertook
in
rouse
There
falling
out
at
tennis
or
perchance
saw
him
enter
such
house
of
sale
Videlicet
brothel
or
so
forth
See
you
now
Your
bait
of
falsehood
takes
this
carp
of
truth
And
thus
do
we
of
wisdom
and
of
reach
With
windlaces
and
with
assays
of
bias
By
indirections
find
directions
out
So
by
my
former
lecture
and
advice
Shall
you
my
son
You
have
me
have
you
not
Rey
My
lord
have
Pol
God
wi
you
fare
you
well
Rey
Good
my
lord
Pol
Observe
his
inclination
in
yourself
Rey
shall
my
lord
Pol
And
let
him
ply
his
music
Rey
Well
my
lord
Pol
Farewell
Exit
Reynaldo
Enter
Ophelia
How
now
Ophelia
what
the
matter
Oph
Alas
my
lord
have
been
so
affrighted
Pol
With
what
the
name
of
God
Oph
My
lord
as
was
sewing
in
my
chamber
Lord
Hamlet
with
his
doublet
all
unbrac
No
hat
upon
his
head
his
stockings
foul
Ungart
red
and
down
gyved
to
his
ankle
Pale
as
his
shirt
his
knees
knocking
each
other
And
with
look
so
piteous
in
purport
As
if
he
had
been
loosed
out
of
hell
To
speak
of
horrors
he
comes
before
me
Pol
Mad
for
thy
love
Oph
My
lord
do
not
know
But
truly
do
fear
it
Pol
What
said
he
Oph
He
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
held
me
hard
Then
goes
he
to
the
length
of
all
his
arm
And
with
his
other
hand
thus
er
his
brow
He
falls
to
such
perusal
of
my
face
As
he
would
draw
it
Long
stay
he
so
At
last
little
shaking
of
mine
arm
And
thrice
his
head
thus
waving
up
and
down
He
rais
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
As
it
did
seem
to
shatter
all
his
bulk
And
end
his
being
that
done
he
lets
me
go
And
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
turn
He
seem
to
find
his
way
without
his
eyes
For
out
doors
he
went
without
their
help
And
to
the
last
bended
their
light
on
me
Pol
Come
go
with
me
will
go
seek
the
king
This
is
the
very
ecstasy
of
love
Whose
violent
property
fordoes
itself
And
leads
the
will
to
desperate
undertakings
As
oft
as
any
passion
under
heaven
That
does
afflict
our
natures
am
sorry
What
have
you
given
him
any
hard
words
of
late
Oph
No
my
good
lord
but
as
you
did
command
did
repel
his
letters
and
denied
His
access
to
me
Pol
That
hath
made
him
mad
am
sorry
that
with
better
heed
and
judgment
had
not
quoted
him
fear
he
did
but
trifle
And
meant
to
wreck
thee
but
beshrew
my
jealousy
It
seems
it
as
proper
to
our
age
To
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
As
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
To
lack
discretion
Come
go
we
to
the
king
This
must
be
known
which
being
kept
close
might
move
More
grief
to
hide
than
hate
to
utter
love

Welcome
dear
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
Moreover
that
we
much
did

to
see
you
The

Our

Something

Of

transformation
so
call
it
Since
nor
the
exterior
nor
the
inward
man
Resembles
that
it
was
What
it
should
be
More
than
his
father
death
that
thus
hath
put
him
So
much
from
the
understanding
of
himself
cannot
dream
of
entreat
you
both
That
being
of
so
young
days
brought
up
with
him
And
since
so
neighbour
to
his
youth
and
humour
That
you
vouchsafe
your
rest
here
in
our
court
Some
little
time
so
by
your
companies
To
draw
him
on
to
pleasures
and
to
gather
So
much
as

may
glean
Whether
aught

unknown
afflicts

Most
fair
return
of

Upon
our
first
he
sent
out
to
suppress
His
nephew
levies
which
to
him
appear
To
be
preparation
gainst
the
Polack
But
better
look
into
he
truly
found
It
was
against
your
highness
whereat
griev
That
so
his
sickness
age
and
impotence
Was
falsely
borne
in
hand
sends
out
arrests
On
Fortinbras
which
he
in
brief
obeys
Receives
rebuke
from
Norway
and
in
fine
Makes
vow
before
his
uncle
never
more
To
give
th
assay
of
arms
against
your
majesty
Whereon
old
Norway
overcome
with
joy
Gives
him
three
thousand
crowns
in
annual
fee
And
his
commission
to
employ
those
soldiers
So
levied
as
before
against
the
Polack
With
an
entreaty

shown
Gives
paper
That
it
might
please
you
to
give
quiet
pass
Through
your

for
this
enterprise
On
such
regards
of
safety
and

As
therein
are
set
down
King
It
likes
us
well
And
at
our
more
consider
time

Answer

upon
this
business
Meantime
we
thank
you

your
well
took
labour
Go
to
your
rest
at

ll
feast
together
Most
welcome
home
Exeunt
Voltimand
and
Cornelius
Pol
This
business
is
well
ended
My
liege
and
madam
to
expostulate
What
majesty
should
be
what
duty
is
Why
day
is
day
night
is
night
and
time
is
time
Were
nothing
but
to
waste
night
day
and
time
Therefore
since
brevity
is
the
soul
of
wit
And
tediousness
the
limbs
and
outward
flourishes
will
be
brief
your
noble
son
is
mad
Mad
call
it
for
to
define
true
madness
What
is
but
to
be
nothing
else
but
mad
But
let
that
go
Queen
More
matter
with
less
art
Pol
Madam
swear
use
no
art
at
all
That
he
is
mad
tis
true
tis
true
tis
pity
And
pity
tis
tis
true
foolish
figure
But
farewell
it
for
will
use
no
art
Mad
let
us
grant
him
then
and
now
remains
That
we
find
out
the
cause
of
this
effect
Or
rather
say
the
cause
of
this
defect
For
this
effect
defective
comes
by
cause
Thus
it
remains
and
the
remainder
thus
Perpend
have
daughter

whilst
she
is

Who
in
her

and
obedience

Hath

Reads
To

In

Good

Doubt

Doubt

But

Adieu
Thine

most
dear

whilst

HAMLET
This
in
obedience
hath
my
daughter
show
me
And
more
above
hath
his
solicitings
As
they
fell
out
by
time
by
means
and
place
All
given
to
mine
ear
King
But
how
hath
she
Receiv
his
love
Pol
What
do
you
think
of
me
King
As
of
man
faithful
and
honourable
Pol
would
fain
prove
so
But
what
might
you
think
When
had
seen
this
hot
love
on
the
wing
As
perceiv
it
must
tell
you
that
Before
my
daughter
told
me
what
might
you
Or
my
dear
majesty
your
queen
here
think
If
had
play
the
desk
or
table
book
Or
given
my
heart
winking
mute
and
dumb
Or
look
upon
this
love
with
idle
sight
What
might
you
think
No
went
round
to
work
And
my
young
mistress
thus
did
bespeak
Lord
Hamlet
is
prince
out
of
thy
sphere
This
must
not
be
and
then
precepts
gave
her
That
she
should
lock
herself
from
his
resort
Admit
no
messengers
receive
no
tokens
Which
done
she
took
the
fruits
of
my
advice
And
he
repulsed
short
tale
to
make
Fell
into
sadness
then
into
fast
Thence
to
watch
thence
into
weakness
Thence
to
lightness
and
by
this
declension
Into
the
madness
wherein
now
he
raves
And
all
we
wail
for
King
Do
you
think
tis
this
Queen
It
may
be
very
likely
Pol
Hath
there
been
such
time
fain
know
that
That
have
positively
said
Tis
so
When
it
prov
otherwise
King
Not
that
know
Pol
Take
this
from
this
if
this
be
otherwise
Points
to
his
head
and
shoulder
If
circumstances
lead
me
will
find
Where
truth
is
hid
though
it
were
hid
indeed
Within
the
centre
King
How
may
we
try
it
further
Pol
You
know
sometimes
he
walks
for
hours
together
Here
in
the
lobby
Queen
So
he
does
indeed
Pol
At
such
time
ll
loose
my
daughter
to
him
Be
you
and
behind
an
arras
then
Mark
the
encounter
if
he
love
her
not
And
he
not
from
his
reason
fall
thereon
Let
me
be
no
assistant
for
state
But
keep
farm
and
carters
King
We
will
try
it
Queen
But
look
where
sadly
the
poor
wretch
comes
reading
Pol
Away
do
beseech
you
both
away
ll
board

presently
give
me
leave
Exeunt

How

my
good
Lord

Well
God
mercy
Pol
Do
you
know
me
my
lord
Ham
Excellent
well
you
re
fishmonger
Pol
Not
my
lord
Ham
Then
would
you
were
so
honest
man
Pol
Honest
my
lord
Ham
Ay
sir
to
be
honest
as
this
world
goes
is
to
be
one
man
picked
out
of
ten
thousand
Pol
That
very
true
my
lord
Ham
For
if
the
sun
breed
maggots
in

being

kissing

Have
you
daughter
Pol
have
my
lord
Ham
Let
her
not
walk
the
sun
conception
is
blessing
but
not
as
your
daughter
may
conceive
friend
look
to
Pol
How
say
you
by
that
Aside
Still
harping
on
my
daughter
yet
he
knew
me
not
at
first
he
said
was
fishmonger
he
is
far
gone
far
gone
and
truly
in
my
youth
suffered
much
extremity
for
love
very
near
this
ll
speak
to
him
again
What
do
you
read
my
lord
Ham
Words
words
words
Pol
What
is
the
matter
my
lord
Ham
Between
who
Pol
mean
the
matter
that
you
read
my
lord
Ham
Slanders
sir
for
the
satirical
slave
says
here
that
old
men
have
grey
beards
that
their
faces
are
wrinkled
their
eyes
purging
thick
amber
and
plum
tree
gum
and
that
they
have
plentiful
lack
of
wit
together
with
most
weak
hams
all
which
sir
though
most
powerfully
and
potently
believe
yet
hold
it
not
honesty
to
have
it
thus
set
down
for
you
yourself
sir
should
be
old
as
am
if
like
crab
you
could
go
backward
Pol
Aside
Though
this
be
madness
yet
there
is
method
in
Will
you
walk
out
of
the
air
my
lord
Ham
Into
my
grave
Pol
Indeed
that
is
out
the
air
Aside
How
pregnant
sometimes
his
replies
are
happiness
that
often
madness
hits
on
which
reason
and
sanity
could
not
so
prosperously
be
delivered
of
will
leave
him
and
suddenly
contrive
the
means
of
meeting
between
him
and
my
daughter
My
honourable
lord
will
most
humbly
take
my
leave
of
you
Ham
You
cannot
sir
take
from
me
anything
that
will
more
willingly
part
withal
except
my
life
except
my
life
except
my
life
Pol
Fare
you
well
my
lord
Ham
These
tedious
old
fools
Enter
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
Pol
You
go
to
seek
the
Lord
Hamlet
there
he
is
Ros
To
Polonius
God
save
you
sir
Exit
Polonius
Guil
My
honoured
lord
Ros
My
most
dear
lord
Ham
My
excellent
good
friends
How
dost
thou
Guildenstern
Ah
Rosencrantz
Good
lads
how
do
ye
both
Ros
As
the
indifferent
children
of
the
earth
Guil
Happy
in
that
we
are
not
over
happy
On
fortune
cap
we
are
not
the
very
button
Ham
Nor
the
soles
of
her
shoe
Ros
Neither
my
lord
Ham
Then
you
live
about
her
waist
or
in
the
middle
of
her
favours
Guil
Faith
her
privates
we
Ham
In
the
secret
parts
of
fortune
most
true
she
is
strumpet
What
the
news
Ros
None
my
lord
but
that
the
world
grown
honest
Ham
Then
is
doomsday
near
but
your
news
is
not
true
Let
me
question
more
in
particular
what
have
you
my
good
friends
deserved
at
the
hands
of
fortune
that
she
sends
you
to
prison
hither
Guil
Prison
my
lord
Ham
Denmark
prison
Ros
Then
is
the
world
one
Ham
goodly
one
in
which
there
are
many
confines
wards
and
dungeons
Denmark
being
one
the
worst
Ros
We
think
not
so
my
lord
Ham
Why
then
tis
none
to
you
for
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
to
me
it
is
prison
Ros
Why
then
your
ambition
makes
it
one
tis
too
narrow
for
your
mind
Ham
God
could
be
bounded
in
nutshell
and
count
myself
king
of
infinite
space
were
it
not
that
have
bad
dreams
Guil
Which
dreams
indeed
are
ambition
for
the
very
substance
of
the
ambitious
is
merely
the
shadow
of
dream
Ham
dream
itself
is
but
shadow
Ros
Truly
and
hold
ambition
of
so
airy
and
light
quality
that
it
is
but
shadow
shadow
Ham
Then
are
our
beggars
bodies
and
our
monarchs
and
outstretch
heroes
the
beggars
shadows
Shall
we
to
the
court
for
by
my
fay
cannot
reason
Ros
and
Guild
We
ll
wait
upon
you
Ham
No
such
matter
will
not
sort
you
with
the
rest
of
my
servants
for
to
speak
to
you
like
an
honest
man
am
most
dreadfully
attended
But
in
the
beaten
way
of
friendship
what
make
you
at
Elsinore
Ros
To
visit
you
my
lord
no
other
occasion
Ham
Beggar
that
am
am
even
poor
in
thanks
but
thank
you
and
sure
dear
friends
my
thanks
are
too
dear
halfpenny
Were
you
not
sent
for
Is
it
your
own
inclining
Is
it
free
visitation
Come
deal
justly
with
me
come
come
nay
speak
Guil
What
should
we
say
my
lord
Ham
Why
anything
but
to
the
purpose
You
were
sent
for
and
there
is
kind
of
confession
in
your
looks
which
your
modesties
have
not
craft
enough
to
colour
know
the
good
king
and
queen
have
sent
for
you
Ros
To
what
end
my
lord
Ham
That
you
must
teach
me
But
let
me
conjure
you
by
the
rights
of
our
fellowship
by
the
consonancy
of
our
youth
by
the
obligation
of
our
ever
preserved
love
and
by
what
more
dear
better
proposer
could
charge
you
withal
be
even
and
direct
with
me
whether
you
were
sent
for
or
no
Ros
To
Guildenstern
What
say
you
Ham
Aside
Nay
then
have
an
eye
of
you
If
you
love
me
hold
not
off
Guil
My
lord
we
were
sent
for
Ham
will
tell
you
why
so
shall
my
anticipation
prevent
your
discovery
and
your
secrecy
to
the
king
and
queen
moult
no
feather
have
of
late
but
wherefore
know
not
lost
all
my
mirth
forgone
all
custom
of
exercises
and
indeed
it
goes
so
heavily
with
my
disposition
that
this
goodly
frame
the
earth
seems
to
me
sterile
promontory
this
most
excellent
canopy
the
air
look
you
this
brave
erhanging
firmament
this
majestical
roof
fretted
with
golden
fire
why
it
appears
no
other
thing
to
me
than
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
What
piece
of
work
is
man
How
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculties
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
And
yet
to
me
what
is
this
quintessence
of
dust
Man
delights
not
me
no
nor
woman
neither
though
by
your
smiling
you
seem
to
say
so
Ros
My
lord
there
was
no
such
stuff
in
my
thoughts
Ham
Why
did
you
laugh
then
when
said
Man
delights
not
me
Ros
To
think
my
lord
if
you
delight
not
in
man
what
lenten
entertainment
the
players
shall
receive
from
you
we
coted
them
on
the
way
and
hither
are
they
coming
to
offer
you
service
Ham
He
that
plays
the
king
shall
be
welcome
his
majesty
shall
have
tribute
of
me
the
adventurous
knight
shall
use
his
foil
and
target
the
lover
shall
not
sigh
gratis
the
humorous
man
shall
end
his
part
in
peace
the
clown
shall
make
those
laugh
whose
lungs
are
tickle
the
sere
and
the
lady
shall
say
her
mind
freely
or
the
blank
verse
shall
halt
for
What
players
are
they
Ros
Even
those
you
were
wont
to
take
such
delight
in
the
tragedians
of
the
city
Ham
How
chances
it
they
travel
their
residence
both
in
reputation
and
profit
was
better
both
ways
Ros
think
their
inhibition
comes
by
the
means
of
the
late
innovation
Ham
Do
they
hold
the
same
estimation
they
did
when
was
in
the
city
Are
they
so
followed
Ros
No
indeed
are
they
not
Ham
How
comes
it
do
they
grow
rusty
Ros
Nay
their
endeavour
keeps
in
the
wonted
pace
but
there
is
sir
an
aery
of
children
little
eyases
that
cry
out
on
the
top
of
question
and
are
most
tyrannically
clapped
for
these
are
now
the
fashion
and
so
berattle
the
common
stages
so
they
call
them
that
many
wearing
rapiers
are
afraid
of
goose
quills
and
dare
scarce
come
thither
Ham
What
are
they
children
who
maintains
em
How
are
they
escoted
Will
they
pursue
the
quality
no
longer
than
they
can
sing
will
they
not
say
afterwards
if
they
should
grow
themselves
to
common
players
as
it
is
most
like
if
their
means
are
no
better
their
writers
do
them
wrong
to
make
them
exclaim
against
their
own
succession
Ros
Faith
there
has
been
much
to
do
on
both
sides
and
the
nation
holds
it
no
sin
to
tarre
them
to
controversy
there
was
for
awhile
no
money
bid
for
argument
unless
the
poet
and
the
player
went
to
cuffs
in
the
question
Ham
Is
possible
Guil
there
has
been
much

What
speech
my
lord
Ham
heard
thee
speak
me
speech
once
but
it
was
never
acted
or
if
it
was
not
above
once
for
the
play
remember
pleased
not
the
million
twas
caviare
to
the
general
but
it
was
as
received
it
and
others
whose
judgments
in
such
matters
cried
in
the
top
of
mine
an
excellent
play
well
digested
in
the
scenes
set
down
with
as
much
modesty
as
cunning
remember
one
said
there
were
no
sallets
in
the
lines
to
make
the
matter
savoury
nor
no
matter
in
the
phrase
that
might
indite
the
author
of
affectation
but
called
it
an
honest
method
as
wholesome
as
sweet
and
by
very
much
more
handsome
than
fine
One
speech
in
it
chiefly
loved
twas
AEneas
tale
to
Dido
and
thereabout
of
it
especially
where
he
speaks
of
Priam
slaughter
if
it
live
in
your
memory
begin
at
this
line
let
me
see
let
me
see
The
rugged
Pyrrhus
like
th
Hyrcanian
beast
it
is
not
so
it
begins
with
Pyrrhus
The
rugged
Pyrrhus
he
whose
sable
arms
Black
as
his
purpose
did
the
night
resemble
When
he
lay
couched
in
the
ominous
horse
Hath
now
this
dread
and
black
complexion
smear
With
heraldry
more
dismal
head
to
foot
Now
is
be
total
gules
horridly
trick
With
blood
of
fathers
mothers
daughters
sons
Bak
and
impasted
with
the
parching
streets
That
lend
tyrannous
and
damned
light
To
their
vile
murders
roasted
in
wrath
and
fire
And
thus
ersized
with
coagulate
gore
With
eyes
like
carbuncles
the
hellish
Pyrrhus
Old
grandsire
Priam
seeks
So
proceed
you
Pol
Fore
God
my
lord
well
spoken
with
good
accent
and
good
discretion
Play
Anon
he
finds
him
Striking
too
short
at
Greeks
his
antique
sword
Rebellious
to
his
arm
lies
where
it
falls
Repugnant
to
command
unequal
match
Pyrrhus
at
Priam
drives
in
rage
strikes
wide
But
with
the
whiff
and
wind
of
his
fell
sword
The
unnerved
father
falls
Then
senseless
Ilium
Seeming
to
feel
this
blow
with
flaming
top
Stoops
to
his
base
and
with
hideous
crash
Takes
prisoner
Pyrrhus
ear
for
lo
his
sword
Which
was
declining
on
the
milky
head
Of
reverend
Priam
seem
the
air
to
stick
So
as
painted
tyrant
Pyrrhus
stood
And
like
neutral
to
his
will
and
matter
Did
nothing
But
as
we
often
see
against
some
storm
silence
in
the
heavens
the
rack
stand
still
The
bold
winds
speechless
and
the
orb
below
As
hush
as
death
anon
the
dreadful
thunder
Doth
rend
the
region
so
after
Pyrrhus
pause
roused
vengeance
sets
him
new
work
And
never
did
the
Cyclops
hammers
fall
On
Mars
armour
forg
for
proof
eterne
With
less
remorse
than
Pyrrhus
bleeding
sword
Now
falls
on
Priam
Out
out
thou
strumpet
Fortune
All
you
gods
In
general
synod
take
away
her
power
Break
all
the

And

As

Run

With

When

Pyrrhus

In
mincing
with
his
sword
her

limbs
The
instant
burst
of
clamour
that
she
made
Unless

Would

Good
my

you
see
the
players
well
bestowed
Do
you

Let
them
be
well
used
for
they
are
the
abstracts
and
brief
chronicles
of
the
time
after
your
death
you
were
better

Pol
My

Ham
Odd

Use

You

Ay
so
God
wi
ye
Now
am
alone
what
rogue
and
peasant
slave
am
Is
it
not
monstrous
that
this
player
here
But
in
fiction
in
dream
of
passion
Could
force
his
soul
so
to
his
own
conceit
That
from
her
working
all
his
visage
wan
Tears
in
his
eyes
distraction
in
aspect
broken
voice
and
his
whole
function
suiting
With
forms
to
his
conceit
And
all
for
nothing
For
Hecuba
What
Hecuba
to
him
or
he
to
Hecuba
That
he
should
weep
for
her
What
would
he
do
Had
he
the
motive
and
the
cue
for
passion
That
have
He
would
drown
the
stage
with
tears
And
cleave
the
general
ear
with
horrid
speech
Make
mad
the
guilty
and
appal
the
free
Confound
the
ignorant
and
amaze
indeed
The
very
faculties
of
eyes
and
ears
Yet
dull
and
muddy
mettled
rascal

unpregnant
of
my

Plucks
off

That

Must

unpack
my
heart
with

And
fall
cursing
like
very
drab
scullion
Fie
upon

About
my
brain
have
heard
That
guilty
creatures
sitting
at
play
Have
by
the
very
cunning
of
the
scene
Been
struck
so
to
the
soul
that
presently
They

proclaim
their
malefactions
For
murder
though
it

no

speak
With

these

May

and
the
devil
hath
power
To
assume
pleasing
shape
yea
and
perhaps
Out
of
my
weakness
and
my
melancholy
As
he
is
very
potent
with
such
spirits
Abuses
me
to
damn
me

have
grounds
More

Enter
King
Queen
Polonius
Ophelia
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
King
And
can
you
by
no
drift
of
circumstance
Get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
Grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
With
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
Ros
He
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
But
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
Guil
Nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
But
with
crafty
madness
keeps
aloof
When
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
Of
his
true
state

Did
he
receive
you
well

Most
like

But
with
much
forcing

Most
free

Did
you
assay

To
any
pastime
Ros
Madam
it
so
fell
out
that
certain
players
We
er
raught
on
the
way
of
these
we
told
him
And
there
did
seem
in
him
kind
of
joy
To
hear
of
it
they
are
about
the
court
And
as
think
they
have
already
order
This
night
to
play
before
him

Tis
most
true
And
he
beseech
me
to
entreat
your
majesties
To
hear
and
see
the

With
all
my
heart

it
doth
much
content

To
hear

further

drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights

We
shall

That

Your
loneliness

Aside
tis
too
true
How
smart
lash
that

doth
give
my
conscience
The
harlot
cheek
beautied
with
plastering

Is
not
more
ugly
to
the

it
Than
is

Enter
Hamlet

To
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
Whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
The
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
Or
to
take
arms
against
sea
of
troubles
And
by
opposing
end
them
To
die
to
sleep
No
more
and
by
sleep
to
say
we
end
The
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
That
flesh
is
heir
to
tis
consummation
Devoutly
to
be
wish
To
die
to
sleep
To
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
there
the
rub
For
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
When
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
Must
give
us
pause
there
the
respect
That
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
For
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
The
oppressor
wrong
the
proud
man
contumely
The
pangs
of
despis
love
the
law
delay
The
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
That
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
When
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
With
bare
bodkin
who
would
these
fardels
bear
To
grunt
and
sweat
under
weary
life
But
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
The
undiscover
country
from
whose
bourn
No
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
And
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
Than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
Thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
And
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
Is
sicklied
er
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
And
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
With
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
And
lose
the
name
of
action
Soft
you
now
The
fair
Ophelia
Nymph

thy
orisons

Could

my

Ham
Ay
truly
for
the
power

beauty
will
sooner
transform
honesty
from

it
is

the
force

honesty

translate

Get

the

with
this
special
observance
that
you
erstep
not
the
modesty
of
nature
for
anything
so
overdone
is
from
the
purpose
of
playing
whose
end
both
at

now
was

is
to
hold

twere

scorn

his

Now
this
overdone

come
tardy
off
though
it
make
the
unskilful
laugh
cannot
but
make
the
judicious
grieve
the
censure

in

erweigh

there
be

profanely

neither

so
strutted

Tis

As

Enter

Full
thirty
times
hath
Phoebus
cart
gone
round
Neptune
salt
wash
and
Tellus
orbed

And
thirty
dozen
moons
with
borrow
sheen
About
the
world
have
times
twelve
thirties
been
Since
love
our
hearts
and
Hymen
did
our
hands
Unite
commutual
in
most
sacred
bands
Queen
So
many
journeys
may
the
sun
and
moon
Make
us
again
count
er
ere
love
be
done
But
woe
is
me
you
are
so
sick
of
late
So
far
from
cheer
and
from
your
former
state
That
distrust
you
Yet
though
distrust
Discomfort
you
my
lord
it
nothing
must
For
women
fear
and
love
holds
quantity
In
neither
aught
or
in
extremity
Now
what
my
love
is
proof
hath
made
you
know
And
as
my
love
is
siz
my
fear
is
so
Where
love
is
great
the
littlest
doubts
are
fear
Where
little
fears
grow
great
great
love
grows
there
King
Faith
must
leave
thee
love
and
shortly
too
My
operant
powers
their
functions
leave
to
do
And
thou
shalt
live
in
this
fair
world
behind
Honour
belov
and
haply
one
as
kind
For
husband
shalt
thou
Queen
confound
the
rest
Such
love
must
needs
be
treason
in
my
breast
In
second
husband
let
me
be
accurst
None
wed
the
second
but
who
kill
the
first
Ham
Aside
Wormwood

The
instances
that
second

move
Are
base
respects
of

but
none
of
love
second
time
kill
my
husband
dead
When
second
husband
kisses
me
in
bed
King
do
believe
you
think
what
now
you
speak
But
what
we
do
determine
oft
we
break
Purpose
is
but
the
slave
to
memory
Of
violent
birth
but
poor
validity
Which
now
like
fruit
unripe
sticks
on
the
tree
But
fall
unshaken
when
they
mellow
be
Most
necessary
tis
that
we
forget
To
pay
ourselves
what
to
ourselves
is
debt
What
to
ourselves
in
passion
we
propose
The
passion
ending
doth
the
purpose
lose
The
violence
of
either
grief
or
joy
Their
own
enactures
with
themselves
destroy
Where
joy
most
revels
grief
doth
most
lament
Grief
joys
joy
grieves
on
slender
accident
This
world
is
not
for
aye
nor
tis
not
strange
That
even
our
loves
should
with
our
fortunes
change
For
tis
question
left
us
yet
to
prove
Whether
love
lead
fortune
or
else
fortune
love
The
great
man
down
you
mark
his
favourite
flies
The
poor
advanc
makes
friends
of
enemies
And
hitherto
doth
love
on
fortune
tend
For
who
not
needs
shall
never
lack
friend
And
who
in
want
hollow
friend
doth
try
Directly
seasons
him
his
enemy
But
orderly
to
end
where
begun
Our
wills
and
fates
do
so
contrary
run
That
our
devices
still
are
overthrown
Our
thoughts
are
ours
their
ends
none
of
our
own
So
think
thou
wilt
no
second
husband
wed
But
die
thy
thoughts
when
thy
first
lord
is
dead
Queen
Nor
earth
to
me
give
food
nor
heaven
light
Sport
and
repose
lock
from
me
day
and
night
To
desperation
turn
my
trust
and
hope
An
anchor
cheer
in
prison
be
my
scope
Each
opposite
that
blanks
the
face
of
joy
Meet
what
would
have
well
and
it
destroy
Both
here
and
hence
pursue
me
lasting
strife
If
once
widow
ever
be
wife
Ham
If
she
should
break
it
now
To
Ophelia
King
Tis
deeply
sworn
Sweet
leave
me
here
awhile
My
spirits
grow
dull
and
fain
would
beguile
The
tedious
day
with
sleep
Sleeps
Queen
Sleep
rock
thy
brain
And
never
come
mischance
between
us
twain
Exit
Ham
Madam
how
like

Ay

Guil
Is
in
his
retirement
marvellous
distempered
Ham
With
drink
sir
Guil
No
my
lord
rather
with
choler
Ham
Your
wisdom
should
show
itself
more
richer
to
signify
this
to
the
doctor
for
me
to
put
him
to
his
purgation
would
perhaps
plunge
him
into
far
more
choler
Guil
Good
my
lord
put
your
discourse
into
some
frame
and
start
not
so
wildly
from
my
affair
Ham
am
tame

Guil
The

your

great

You
are
welcome
Guil
Nay
good
my

this
courtesy
is
not
of
the
right
breed
If
it
shall
please
you
to
make
me
wholesome
answer
will
do
your

commandment
if
not
your
pardon

my
return
shall
be
the
end
of
my

Ham
Sir
cannot
Guil
What
my

Ham
Make
you
wholesome
answer
my
wit
diseased
but
sir
such
answer
as
can
make
you
shall
command
or
rather
as
you
say
my
mother
therefore
no
more
but
to
the
matter
my
mother
you
say
Ros
Then
thus
she
says
your
behaviour
hath
struck
her
into
amazement
and
admiration
Ham
wonderful
son
that
can
so
stonish
mother
But
is
there
no
sequel
at
the
heels
of
this

admiration
Ros
She
desires
to
speak
with
you
in
her
closet
ere
you
go

We

ten
times
our

Have
you
any
further

My

you
once
did
love
me
Ham
And
so

these
pickers

stealers
Ros
Good
my
lord
what
is
your
cause
of
distemper
you
do
surely
bar
the
door
upon
your
own
liberty
if
you
deny
your
griefs
to
your
friend
Ham
Sir
lack
advancement
Ros
How
can
that
be
when
you
have
the
voice
of
the
king
himself
for
your
succession
in
Denmark
Ham
Ay

but
While

musty
Re

But

any
utterance
of

Ham
Why
look
you
now
how
unworthy
thing
you
make
of
me
You
would
play
upon
me
you
would
seem
to
know
my
stops
you
would
pluck
out
the
heart
of
my
mystery
you
would
sound
me
from
my
lowest
note
to
the
top
of
my
compass
and
there
is
much
music
excellent

in
this
little

yet
cannot
you
make
it
speak
Sblood
do
you
think

easier

Call

you
can
fret
me
you
cannot
play
upon
me
Enter
Polonius

By

Methinks

It

it

To

safe
That

The

With

the
strength

of

To

That
spirit
upon
whose

rest
The
lives

The
cease

ten
thousand
lesser

Are

Each
small
annexment
petty
consequence
Attends
the
boisterous
ruin
Never

general
groan

Arm

as

wisely

Since

The

Fare

Exit
Polonius
my

It
hath
the
primal
eldest
curse
upon

murder
Pray
can
not
Though
inclination
be
as
sharp
as
will
My
stronger
guilt
defeats
my
strong
intent
And
like
man
to
double
business
bound
stand
in
pause
where
shall
first
begin
And
both
neglect
What
if
this
cursed
hand
Were
thicker
than
itself
with
brother
blood
Is
there
not
rain
enough
in
the
sweet
heavens
To
wash
it
white
as
snow
Whereto
serves
mercy
But
to
confront
the
visage
of
offence
And
what
in
prayer
but
this
twofold
force
To
be
forestalled
ere
we
come
to
fall
Or
pardon
being
down
Then
ll
look
up
My
fault
is
past
But
what
form
of
prayer
Can
serve
my
turn
Forgive
me
my
foul
murder
That
cannot

Of
those
effects
for
which
did
the

My
crown
mine
own
ambition

May
one
be
pardon
and
retain
the
offence
In

Offence
gilded

There

no

In

compell
Even

faults
To

What

At

about

As

As

Ay

If

If

That

bulwark
against

Queen
What
have
done
that
thou
dar
st
wag
thy

In
noise
so
rude
against

Ham
Such
an
act
That
blurs
the
grace
and
blush
of
modesty
Calls
virtue
hypocrite
takes
off
the
rose
From
the
fair
forehead
of
an
innocent
love
And
sets
blister
there
makes
marriage
vows
As
false
as
dicers
oaths
such
deed
As
from
the
body
of
contraction
plucks
The
very
soul
and
sweet
religion
makes
rhapsody
of
words
heaven
face
doth
glow
Yea
this
solidity
and
compound
mass
With
tristful
visage
as
against
the
doom
Is
thought
sick
at
the
act
Queen
Ah
me
what
act
That
roars
so
loud
and
thunders
in
the
index
Ham
Look
here
upon
this
picture
and
on
this
The
counterfeit
presentment
of
two
brothers
See
what
grace
was
seated
on
this
brow
Hyperion
curls
the
front
of
Jove
himself
An
eye
like
Mars
to
threaten
and
command
station
like
the
herald
Mercury
New
lighted
on
heaven
kissing
hill
combination
and
form
indeed
Where
every
god
did
seem
to
set
his
seal
To
give
the
world
assurance
of
man
This
was
your
husband
Look
you
now
what
follows
Here
is
your
husband
like
milldew
ear
Blasting
his
wholesome
brother
Have
you
eyes
Could
you
on
this
fair
mountain
leave
to
feed
And
batten
on
this
moor
Ha
have
you
eyes
You
cannot
call
it
love
for
at
your
age
The
hey
day
in
the
blood
is
tame
it
humble
And
waits
upon
the
judgment
and
what
judgment
Would
step
from
this
to
this
Sense
sure
you
have
Else
could
you
not
have
motion
but
sure
that
sense
Is
apoplex
for
madness
would
not
err
Nor
sense
to
ecstacy
was
ne
er
so
thrall
But
it
reserv
some
quantity
of
choice
To
serve
in

Ears

Or

Could

Rebellious

If

To
flaming

let
virtue
be

wax
And
melt
in
her

fire
proclaim
no

When
the
compulsive
ardour
gives

Since

And

As

In

Stew
in

Over

No

murderer

that
is
not
twentieth
part
the
tithe
Of
your
precedent

vice
of

cutpurse
of

That

Alas
he

Ham
Do
you
not
come
your
tardy
son
to
chide
That
laps
in

and
passion
lets
go
by
The
important
acting
of
your
dread
command
say
Ghost
Do
not
forget
This
visitation
Is
but
to
whet
thy
almost
blunted
purpose
But
look
amazement
on
thy
mother
sits
step
between

and

Conceit
in

bodies
strongest

Speak
to

Hamlet
Ham
How
is
it
with
you
lady
Queen
Alas
how
is
with
you
That
you
do
bend
your
eye
on
vacancy
And
with
the
incorporal
air
do
hold
discourse
Forth
at
your
eyes
your
spirits
wildly
peep
And
as
the
sleeping
soldiers
in
the
alarm
Your
bedded
hairs
like
life
in
excrements
Start
up
and
stand
an
end
gentle
son
Upon
the
heat
and
flame
of
thy
distemper
Sprinkle
cool
patience
Whereon
do
you
look
Ham
On
him
on
him
Look
you
how
pale
he
glares
His
form
and
cause
conjoin
preaching
to
stones
Would
make
them
capable
Do
not
look
upon
me
Lest
with
this
piteous
action
you
convert
My
stern
effects
then
what
have
to
do
Will
want
true
colour
tears
perchance
for
blood
Queen
To
whom
do
you
speak
this
Ham
Do
you
see
nothing
there
Queen
Nothing
at
all
yet
all
that
is

Ham
Nor
did
you
nothing
hear
Queen
No
nothing
but
ourselves
Ham
Why
look

there
look
how
it
steals
away
My
father
in
his

as

Look
where

goes

at

Exit

Queen
This
is
the
very
coinage
of
your
brain
This
bodiless
creation
ecstasy
Is
very
cunning
in
Ham
Ecstasy
My
pulse
as
yours
doth
temperately
keep
time
And
makes
as
healthful
music
it
is
not
madness
That
have
utter
bring
me
to
the
test
And
the
matter
will
re
word
which
madness
Would
gambol
from
Mother
for
love
of
grace
Lay
not
that
flattering
unction
to
your
soul
That
not
your
trespass
but
my
madness
speaks
It
will
but
skin
and
film
the
ulcerous
place
Whilst
rank
corruption
mining
all
within
Infects
unseen
Confess
yourself
to
heaven
Repent
what
past
avoid
what
is
to
come
And
do
not
spread
the
compost
on
the
weeds
To
make
them
ranker
Forgive
me
this
my
virtue
For
in
the
fatness
of
these
pursy
times
Virtue
itself
of
vice
must
pardon
beg
Yea
curb
and
woo
for
leave
to
do
him
good
Queen
Hamlet
thou
hast
cleft
my
heart
in
twain
Ham
throw
away
the
worser
part
of
it
And
live
the
purer
with
the
other
half
Good
night
but
go
not
to
mine
uncle
bed
Assume
virtue
if
you
have
it
not
That
monster
custom
who
all
sense
doth
eat
Of
habits
evil
is
angel
yet
in
this
That
to
the
use
of
actions
fair
and
good
He
likewise
gives
frock
or
livery
That
aptly
is
put
on
Refrain
to
night
And
that
shall
lend
kind
of
easiness
To
the
next
abstinence
the
next
more
easy
For
use
almost
can
change
the
stamp
of
nature
And
either
curb
the
devil
or
throw
him
out
With
wondrous
potency
Once
more
good
night
And
when
you
are
desirous
to
be
bles
ll
blessing
beg
of
you
For
this
same
lord
Pointing
to
Polonius
do
repent
but
heaven
hath
pleas
it
so
To
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
That
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
will
bestow
him
and
will
answer
well
The
death
gave
him
So
again
good
night
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind
Thus
bad
begins
and
worse
remains
behind
One
word
more
good
lady
Queen
What
shall
do
Ham
Not
this
by
no
means
that
bid
you
do
Let
the
bloat
king
tempt
you
again
to
bed
Pinch
wanton
on
your
cheek
call
you
his
mouse
And
let
him
for
pair
of
reechy
kisses
Or
paddling
in
your
neck
with
his
damn
fingers
Make
you
to
ravel
all
this
matter
out
That
essentially
am
not
in
madness
But
mad
in
craft
Twere
good
you

know
For
who
that

queen
fair

Would
from
paddock
from

Such

No

Unpeg

Let

To

And

Be

Led

Makes

Exposing

To

Even

Rightly

Is

Go

Spurns

her

Yet
the

The

And
botch
the

up
fit

their

Which
as
her

Indeed

nothing

Now

your

my
acquittance
seal
And
you
must
put
me
in
your
heart
for
friend
Sith
you
have
heard
and
with
knowing
ear
That
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
Pursu
my
life
Laer
It
well
appears
but
tell
me
Why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
So
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
As
by
your
safety
wisdom
all
things
else
You
mainly
were
stirr
up
King
for
two
special
reasons
Which
may
to
you
perhaps
seem
much
unsinew
But
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
The
queen
his
mother
Lives
almost
by
his
looks
and
for
myself
My
virtue
or
my
plague
be
it
either
which
She
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
That
as
the
star
moves
not
but
in
his
sphere
could
not
but
by
her
The
other
motive
Why
to
public
count
might
not
go
Is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
Who
dipping
all
his
faults
in
their
affection
Would
like
the
spring
that
turneth
wood
to
stone
Convert
his
gyves
to
graces
so
that
my
arrows
Too
slightly
timber
for
so
loud
wind
Would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
And
not
where
had
aim
them
Laer
And
so
have
noble
father
lost
sister
driven
into
desperate
terms
Whose
worth
if
praises
may
go
back
again
Stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
For
her
perfections
but
my
revenge
will
come
King
Break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
you
must
not
think
That
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
That
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
And
think
it
pastime
You
shortly
shall
hear
more
lov
your
father
and
we
love
ourself
And
that
hope
will
teach
you
to
imagine

And
for
his
death
no
wind
shall
breathe
But
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practice
And
call
it
accident
Laer
My
lord
will
be
rul
The
rather
if
you
could
devise
it
so
That
might
be
the
organ
King
It
falls
right
You
have
been
talk
of
since
your
travel
much
And
that
in
Hamlet
hearing
for
quality
Wherein
they
say
you
shine
your
sum
of
parts
Did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
As
did
that
one
and
that
in
my
regard
Of
the
unworthiest
siege
Laer
What
part
is
that
my
lord
King
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
Yet
needful
too
for
youth
no
less
becomes
The
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
Than
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
Importing
health
and
graveness
Two
months
since
Here
was
gentleman
of
Normandy
ve
seen
myself
and
serv
against
the
French
And
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
Had
witchcraft
in
he
grew
unto
his
seat
And
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
As
had
he
been
incorps
and
demi
natur
With
the
brave
beast
so
far
he
topp
my
thought
That
in
forgery
of
shapes
and
tricks
Come
short
of
what
he
did
Laer
Norman
was
King
Norman
Laer
Upon
my
life
Lamond
King
The
very
same
Laer
know
him
well
he
is
the
brooch
indeed
And
gem
of
all
the
nation
King
He
made
confession
of
you
And
gave
you
such
masterly
report
For
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
And
for
your
rapier
most
especially
That
he
cried
out
twould
be
sight
indeed
If
one
could
match
you
the
scrimers
of
their
nation
He
swore
had
neither
motion
guard
nor
eye
If
you
oppos
them
Sir
this
report
of
his
Did
Hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
That
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
Your
sudden
coming
er
to
play
with
him
Now
out
of
this
Laer
What
out
of
this
my
lord
King
Laertes
was
your
father
dear
to
you
Or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
sorrow
face
without
heart
Laer
Why
ask
you
this
King
Not
that
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
But
that
know
love
is
begun
by
time
And
that
see
in
passages
of
proof
Time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
There
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
And
nothing
is
at
like
goodness
still
For
goodness
growing
to
plurisy
Dies
in
his
own
too
much
that
we
would
do
We
should
do
when
we
would
for
this
would
changes
And
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
As
there
are
tongues
are
hands
are
accidents
And
then
this
should
is
like
spendthrift
sigh
That
hurts
by
easing
But
to
the
quick
the
ulcer
Hamlet
comes
back
what
would
you
undertake
To
show
yourself
your
father
son
in
deed
More
than
in
words
Laer
To
cut
his
throat
the
church
King
No
place
indeed
should
murder
sanctuarize
Revenge
should
have
no
bounds
But
good
Laertes
Will
you
do
this
keep
close
within
your
chamber
Hamlet
return
shall
know
you
are
come
home
We
ll
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
And
set
double
varnish
on
the
fame
The
Frenchman
gave
you
bring
you
in
fine
together
And
wager
on
your
heads
he
being
remiss
Most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
Will
not
peruse
the
foils
so
that
with
ease
Or
with
little
shuffling
you
may
choose
sword
unbated
and
in
pass
of
practice
Requite
him
for
your
father
Laer
will
do
And
for
that
purpose
ll
anoint
my
sword
bought
an
unction
of
mountebank
So
mortal
that
but
dip
knife
in
it
Where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
Collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
Under
the
moon
can
save
the
thing
from
death
This
is
but
scratch
withal
ll
touch
my
point
With
this
contagion
that
if
gall
him
slightly
It
may
be
death
King
Let
further
think
of
this
Weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
May
fit
us
to
our
shape
if
this
should
fail
And
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
Twere
better
not
assay
therefore
this
project
Should
have
back
or
second
that
might
hold
If
this
did
blast
in
proof
Soft
let
me
see
We
ll
make
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
ha
When
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
As
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
And
that
he
calls
for
drink
ll
have
prepar
him
chalice
for
the
nonce
whereon
but
sipping
If
he
by
chance
escape
your
venom
stuck
Our
purpose
may
hold
there
Enter
Queen
How
now
sweet
queen
Queen
One
woe
doth
tread
upon
another
heel
So
fast
they
follow
your
sister
drown
Laertes
Laer
Drown
where
Queen
There
is
willow
grows
aslant
brook
That
shows
his
hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy
stream
There
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
Of
crowflowers
nettles
daisies
and
long
purples
That
liberal
shepherds
give
grosser
name
But
our
cold
maids
do
dead
men
fingers
call
them
There
on
the
pendant
boughs
her
coronet
weeds
Clamb
ring
to
hang
an
envious
sliver
broke
When
down
her
weedy
trophies
and
herself
Fell
in
the
weeping
brook
Her
clothes
spread
wide
And
mermaid
like
awhile
they
bore
her
up
Which
time
she
chaunted
snatches
of
old
tunes
As
one
incapable
of
her
own
distress
Or
like
creature
native
and
indu
Unto
that
element
but
long
it
could
not
be
Till
that
her
garments
heavy
with
their
drink
Pull
the
poor
wretch
from
her
melodious
lay
To
muddy
death
Laer
Alas
then
she
is

Queen
Drown
drown
Laer
Too
much
of
water
hast
thou
poor
Ophelia
And
therefore
forbid
my
tears
but
yet
It
is
our
trick
nature
her
custom
holds
Let
shame
say
what
it
will
when
these
are
gone
The
woman
will
be
out
Adieu
my
lord
have
speech
of
fire
that
fain
would
blaze
But
that
this
folly
douts
it
Exit
King
Let
follow
Gertrude
How
much
had
to
do
to
calm
his
rage
Now
fear
this
will
give
it
start
again
Therefore
let
follow

Clown

these

How

Of

Clown
Cannot

Here

Where

Twere

Ham
No

with
modesty
enough
and
likelihood
to
lead
it
as
thus
Alexander
died
Alexander

buried
Alexander

the

Until

Scene
II
hall
in
the
Castle
Enter
Hamlet
and
Horatio
Ham
So
much
for
this
sir
now
let
me
see
the
other
You
do
remember
all
the
circumstance
Hor
Remember
it
my
lord
Ham
Sir
in
my
heart
there
was
kind
of
fighting
That
would
not
let
me
sleep
methought
lay
Worse
than
the
mutinies
in
the
bilboes
Rashly
And
prais
be
rashness
for
it
let
us
know
Our
indiscretion
sometime
serves
us
well
When
our
deep
plots
do
fail
and
that
should
teach
us
There
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
Rough
hew
them
how
we
will
Hor
That
is
most
certain
Ham
Up
from
my
cabin
My
sea
gown
scarf
about
me
in
the
dark
Grop
to
find
out
them
had
my
desire
Finger
their
packet
and
in
fine
withdrew
To
mine
own
room
again
making
so
bold
My
fears
forgetting
manners
to
unseal
Their
grand
commission
where
found
Horatio
royal
knavery
an
exact
command
Larded
with
many
several
sorts
of
reasons
Importing
Denmark
health
and
England
too
With
ho
such
bugs
and
goblins
in
my
life
That
on
the
supervise
no
leisure
bated
No
not
to
stay
the
grinding
of
the
axe
My
head
should
be
struck
off
Hor
Is
possible
Ham
Here
the
commission
read
it
at
more
leisure
But
wilt
thou
bear
me
how
did
proceed
Hor
beseech
you
Ham
Being
thus
benetted
round
with
villanies
Or
could
make
prologue
to
my
brains
They
had
begun
the
play
sat
me
down
Devis
new
commission
wrote
it
fair
once
did
hold
it
as
our
statists
do
baseness
to
write
fair
and
labour
much
How
to
forget
that
learning
but
sir
now
It
did
me
yeoman
service
Wilt
thou
know
The
effect
of
what
wrote
Hor
Ay
good
my
lord
Ham
An
earnest
conjuration
from
the
king
As
England
was
his
faithful
tributary
As
love
between
them
like
the
palm
might
flourish
As
peace
should
still
her
wheaten
garland
wear
And
stand
comma
tween
their
amities
And
many
such
like
as
of
great
charge
That
on
the
view
and
know
of
these
contents
Without
debatement
further
more
or
less
He
should
the
bearers
put
to
sudden
death
Not
shriving
time
allow
Hor
How
was
this
seal
Ham
Why
even
in
that
was
heaven
ordinant
had
my
father
signet
in
my
purse
Which
was
the
model
of
that
Danish
seal
Folded
the
writ
up
in
the
form
of
the
other
Subscrib
it
gave
the
impression
plac
it
safely
The
changeling
never
known
Now
the
next
day
Was
our
sea
fight
and
what
to
this
was
sequent
Thou
know
st
already
Hor
So
Guildenstern
and
Rosencrantz
go
to
Ham
Why
man
they
did
make
love
to
this
employment
They
are
not
near
my
conscience
their
defeat
Does
by
their
own
insinuation
grow
Tis
dangerous
when
the
baser
nature
comes
Between
the
pass
and
fell
incensed
points
Of
mighty
opposites
Hor
Why
what
king
is
this
Ham
Does
it
not
thinks
thee
stand
me
now
upon
He
that
hath
kill
my
king
and
whor
my
mother
Popp
in
between
the
election
and
my
hopes
Thrown
out
his
angle
for
my
proper
life
And
with
such
cozenage
is
not
perfect
conscience
To
quit
him
with
this
arm
and
is
not
to
be
damn
To
let
this
canker
of
our
nature
come
In
further
evil
Hor
It
must
be
shortly
known
to
him
from
England
What
is
the
issue
of
the
business
there
Ham
It
will
be
short
the
interim
is
mine
And
man
life
is
no
more
than
to
say
One
But
am
very
sorry
good
Horatio
That
to
Laertes
forgot
myself
For
by
the
image
of
my
cause
see
The
portraiture
of
his
ll
court
his
favours
But
sure
the
bravery
of
his
grief
did
put
me
Into
towering
passion
Hor
Peace
who
comes
here
Enter
Osric
Osr
Your
lordship
is
right
welcome
back
to
Denmark
Ham
humbly
thank
you
sir
Dost
know
this
water
fly
Hor
No
my
good
lord
Ham
Thy
state
is
the
more
gracious
for
tis
vice
to
know
him
He
hath
much
land
and
fertile
let
beast
be
lord
of
beasts
and
his
crib
shall
stand
at
the
king
mess
tis
chough
but
as
say
spacious
in
the
possession
of
dirt
Osr
Sweet
lord
if
your
lordship
were
at
leisure
should
impart
thing
to
you
from
his
majesty
Ham
will
receive
it
with
all
diligence
of
spirit
Put
your
bonnet
to
his
right
use
tis
for
the
head
Osr
thank
your
lordship
is
very
hot
Ham
No
believe
me
tis
very
cold
the
wind
is
northerly
Osr
It
is
indifferent
cold
my
lord
indeed
Ham
Methinks
it
is
very
sultry
and
hot
for
my
complexion
Osr
Exceedingly
my
lord
it
is
very
sultry
as
twere
cannot
tell
how
But
my
lord
his
majesty
bade
me
signify
to
you
that
he
has
laid
great
wager
on
your
head
Sir
this
is
the
matter
Ham
beseech
you
remember
Hamlet
moves
him
to
put
on
his
hat
Osr
Nay
in
good
faith
for
mine
ease
in
good
faith
Sir
here
is
newly
come
to
court
Laertes
believe
me
an
absolute
gentleman
full
of
most
excellent
differences
of
very
soft
society
and
great
showing
indeed
to
speak
feelingly
of
him
he
is
the
card
or
calendar
of
gentry
for
you
shall
find
in
him
the
continent
of
what
part
gentleman
would
see
Ham
Sir
his
definement
suffers
no
perdition
in
you
though
know
to
divide
him
inventorially
would
dizzy
the
arithmetic
of
memory
and
yet
but
yaw
neither
in
respect
of
his
quick
sail
But
in
the
verity
of
extolment
take
him
to
be
soul
of
great
article
and
his
infusion
of
such
dearth
and
rareness
as
to
make
true
diction
of
him
his
semblable
is
his
mirror
and
who
else
would
trace
him
his
umbrage
nothing
more
Osr
Your
lordship
speaks
most
infallibly
of
him
Ham
The
concernancy
sir
why
do
we
wrap
the
gentleman
in
our
more
rawer
breath
Osr
Sir
Hor
Is
not
possible
to
understand
in
another
tongue
You
will
do
sir
really
Ham
What
imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
Osr
Of
Laertes
Hor
His
purse
is
empty
already
all
golden
words
are
spent
Ham
Of
him
sir
Osr
know
you
are
not
ignorant
Ham
would
you
did
sir
yet
in
faith
if
you
did
it
would
not
much
approve
me
Well
sir
Osr
You
are
not
ignorant
of
what
excellence
Laertes
is
Ham
dare
not
confess
that
lest
should
compare
with
him
in
excellence
but
to
know
man
well
were
to
know
himself
Osr
mean
sir
for
his
weapon
but
in
the
imputation
laid
on
him
by
them
in
his
meed
he
unfellowed
Ham
What
his
weapon
Osr
Rapier
and
dagger
Ham
That
two
of
his
weapons
but
well
Osr
The
king
sir
hath
wager
with
him
six
Barbary
horses
against
the
which
he
has
imponed
as
take
it
six
French
rapiers
and
poniards
with
their
assigns
as
girdle
hangers
and
so
three
of
the
carriages
in
faith
are
very
dear
to
fancy
very
responsive
to
the
hilts
most
delicate
carriages
and
of
very
liberal
conceit
Ham
What
call
you
the
carriages
Hor
knew
you
must
be
edified
by
the
margent
ere
you
had
done
Osr
The
carriages
sir
are
the
hangers
Ham
The
phrase
would
be
more
german
to
the
matter
if
we
could
carry
cannon
by
our
sides
would
it
might
be
hangers
till
then
But
on
six
Barbary
horses
against
six
French
swords
their
assigns
and
three
liberal
conceited
carriages
that
the
French
bet
against
the
Danish
why
is
this
all
imponed
as
you
call
it
Osr
The
king
sir
hath
laid
that
in
dozen
passes
between
your
and
him
he
shall
not
exceed
you
three
hits
he
hath
laid
on
twelve
for
nine
and
it
would
come
to
immediate
trial
if
your
lordship
would
vouchsafe
the
answer
Ham
How
if
answer
no
Osr
mean
my
lord
the
opposition
of
your
person
in
trial
Ham
Sir
will
walk
here
in
the
hall
if
it
please
his
majesty
it
is
the
breathing
time
of
day
with
me
let
the
foils
be
brought
the
gentleman
willing
and
the
king
hold
his
purpose
will
win
for
him
if
can
if
not
will
gain
nothing
but
my
shame
and
the
odd
hits
Osr
Shall
re
deliver
you
en
so
Ham
To
this
effect
sir
after
what
flourish
your
nature
will
Osr
commend
my
duty
to
your
lordship
Ham
Yours
yours
Exit
Osric
He
does
well
to
commend
it
himself
there
are
no
tongues
else
for
turn
Hor
This
lapwing
runs
away
with
the
shell
on
his
head
Ham
He
did
comply
with
his
dug
before
he
suck
it
Thus
has
he
and
many
more
of
the
same
bevy
that
know
the
drossy
age
dotes
on
only
got
the
tune
of
the
time
and
outward
habit
of
encounter
kind
of
yesty
collection
which
carries
them
through
and
through
the
most
fanned
and
winnowed
opinions
and
do
but
blow
them
to
their
trial
the
bubbles
are
out
Enter
Lord
Lord
My
lord
his
majesty
commended
him
to
you
by
young
Osric
who
brings
back
to
him
that
you
attend
him
in
the
hall
he
sends
to
know
if
your
pleasure
hold
to
play
with
Laertes
or
that
you

take
longer
time
Ham

my
purposes

Lord
The
King

coming
down
Ham
In
happy
time
Lord
The
queen
desires
you
to
use
some
gentle
entertainment
to
Laertes
before
you
fall
to
play
Ham
She
well
instructs
me
Exit
Lord
Hor
You
will
lose
this
wager
my
lord
Ham
do
not
think
so
since
he
went
into
France
have
been
in
continual
practice
shall
win
at
the
odds
But
thou
wouldst
not
think
how
ill
all
here
about
my
heart
but
it
is
no
matter
Hor
Nay
good
my
lord
Ham
It
is
but
foolery
but
it
is
such
kind
of
gain
giving
as
would
perhaps
trouble
woman
Hor
If
your
mind
dislike
anything
obey
it
will
forestall
their
repair
hither
and
say
you
are
not
fit
Ham
Not
whit
we
defy
augury
there
special
providence
in
the
fall
of
sparrow
If
it
be
now
tis
not
to
come
if
it
be
not
to
come
it
will
be
now
if
it
be
not
now
yet
it
will
come
the
readiness
is
all
since
no
man
has
aught
of
what
he
leaves
what
is
to
leave
betimes
Enter
King
Queen
Laertes
Lords
Osric
and
Attendants

this
hand
from
me
The
King

into
Hamlet
Ham
Give

your
pardon

done
you
wrong
But
pardon
as
you
are
gentleman
This
presence
knows
and
you
must
needs
have
heard
How
am
punish
with
sore
distraction
What
have
done
That
might
your
nature
honour
and
exception
Roughly
awake
here
proclaim
was
madness
Was
Hamlet
wrong
Laertes
Never
Hamlet
If
Hamlet
from
himself
be
ta
en
away
And
when
he
not
himself
does
wrong
Laertes
Then
Hamlet
does
it
not
Hamlet
denies
it
Who
does
it
then
His
madness
if
be
so
Hamlet
is
of
the
faction
that
is
wrong
His
madness
is
poor
Hamlet
enemy
Sir
in
this
audience
Let
my
disclaiming
from
purpos
evil
Free
me
so
far
in
your
most
generous
thoughts
That
have
shot
my
arrow
er
the
house
And
hurt
my
brother
Laer
am
satisfied
in
nature
Whose
motive
in
this
case
should
stir
me
most
To
my
revenge
But
in

Till

And

Richer

Give

Wretched

You

That

Had

Is

you
But
let

Thou

and
my

aright
To
the
unsatisfied
Hor
Never

Here

Ham
As
thou

man
Give
me
the
cup
let
go
by
heaven
ll
have
good
Horatio
what
wounded
name
Things
standing
thus
unknown
shall
live
behind
me
If
thou
didst
ever
hold
me
in
thy
heart
Absent
thee
from
felicity
awhile
And
in
this
harsh
world
draw
thy
breath
in
pain
To
tell
my
story
March
afar
off
and
shot
within
What
warlike
noise
is
this
Osr
Young
Fortinbras
with
conquest
come
from
Poland
To
the
ambassadors
of
England
gives
This
warlike
volley
Ham
die
Horatio
The
potent
poison
quite
er
crows
my
spirit
cannot
live
to
hear
the
news
from
England
But
do
prophesy
the
election
lights
On
Fortinbras
he
has
my
dying
voice
So
tell
him
with
the
occurrents
more
and
less
Which
have
solicited
the
rest
is
silence
Dies
Hor
Now
cracks
noble
heart
Good
night
sweet
prince
And
flights
of
angels
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
Why
does
the
drum
come
hither
March
within
Enter
Fortinbras
the
English
Ambassadors
and
others
Fort
Where
is
this
sight
Hor
What
is
it
you
will
see
If
aught
of
woe
or
wonder
cease
your
search
Fort
This
quarry
cries
on
havoc
proud
death
What
feast
is
toward
in
thine
eternal
cell
That
thou
so
many
princes
at
shot
So
bloodily
hast
struck
Ambassador
The
sight
is
dismal
And
our
affairs
from
England
come
too
late
The
ears
are
senseless
that
should
give
us
hearing
To
tell
him
his
commandment
is
fulfill
That
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
are
dead
Where
should
we
have
our
thanks
Hor
Not
from
his
mouth
Had
it
the
ability
of
life
to
thank
you
He
never
gave
commandment
for
their
death
But
since
so
jump
upon
this
bloody
question
You
from
the
Polack
wars
and
you
from
England
Are
here
arriv
give
order
that
these
bodies
High
on
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
And
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
How
these
things
came
about
so
shall
you
hear
Of
carnal
bloody
and
unnatural
acts
Of
accidental
judgments
casual
slaughters
Of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forc
cause
And
in
this
upshot
purposes
mistook
Fall
on
the
inventors
heads
all
this
can
Truly
deliver
Fort
Let
us
haste
to
hear
it
And
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
For
me
with
sorrow
embrace
my
fortune
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
Which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
Hor
Of
that
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
And
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
But
let
this
same
be
presently
perform
Even
while
men
minds
are
wild
lest
more
mischance
On
plots
and
errors
happen
Fort
Let
four
captains
Bear
Hamlet
like
soldier
to
the
stage
For
he
was
likely
had
he
been
put
on
To
have
prov
most
royally
and
for
his
passage
The
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
Speak
loudly
for
him
Take
up
the
bodies
Such
sight
as
this
Becomes
the
field
but
here
shows
much
amiss
Go
bid
the
soldiers
shoot
dead
march
Exeunt
bearing
off
the
dead
bodies
after
the
which
peal
of
ordnance
is
shot
off
